All original files, written with Socket.io and WebSocket were deleted on 5/13/2020 in an 
effort to start over. With input from the PM, it is our plan to create a browser based chat application
with Firebase. 

Firebase is Google's mobile platform that contains all applications and modules required
for anything web based, be it mobile or browser. It contains everything from database to
authentication. Best of all, its lowest tier is free.

This file will serve as a running account of events during the creation of CS300IM, an
instant messaging application written for CS300 at PSU. This is a bit of a readme/diary
