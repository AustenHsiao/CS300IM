All original files, written with Socket.io and WebSocket were deleted on 5/13/2020 in an 
effort to start over. With input from the PM, it is our plan to create a browser based chat application
with Firebase. 

Firebase is Google's mobile platform that contains all applications and modules required
for anything web based, be it mobile or browser. It contains everything from database to
authentication. Best of all, its lowest tier is free.

This file will serve as a running account of events during the creation of CS300IM, an
instant messaging application written for CS300 at PSU. This is a bit of a readme/diary

Using firebase on top of an existing website requires the user to have total control over
the domain. Since I'm not the owner of pdx.edu, I'm at a standstill trying to use the full 
firebase functionality, so I've decided to make a local chat app. 
Authentication added 05/20/2020
Chat display added 05/21/2020

It's very barebones.
chatapp.html may be removed, its existence is currently redundant
End 05/21/2020

End 05/22/2020
________________________________________________________________________________________

Added unique chat room lists (unique to each user) 05/28/2020
End 05/28/2020

Fixed bug in generating the unique chat room lists-- would show multiples of the same room (6/1/2020)
